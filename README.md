# Autonomous-Thermal-Vision

**Making autonomous vehicles safer by detecting pedestrians in real-time using thermal cameras.**

A Deep Learning-based system that detects humans in thermal images, specifically designed to improve autonomous vehicle navigation in low-visibility conditions such as night-time, fog, or poor lighting.

## Problem

Autonomous vehicles must reliably detect pedestrians and obstacles in challenging environments.  
Traditional RGB-based detection often fails in low-visibility scenarios, increasing the risk of accidents and reducing navigation safety.

## Solution

- Retrained a **state-of-the-art YOLOv8 detector** using a **custom thermal image dataset** simulating real-world pedestrian and obstacle scenarios.
- Dataset covers:
  - Pedestrians and obstacles at varying distances.
  - Diverse movement patterns.
  - Different environmental conditions (night, fog, heat variation).
- Developed a **web-based interface** to:
  - Upload thermal images and videos for human detection.
  - Dynamically manage multiple YOLO models.
  - Visualize detection results in real-time.
- Minimal dataset approach for efficient training without compromising accuracy.
- Transfer learning applied using a pretrained YOLO model with frozen backbone for optimized training.
